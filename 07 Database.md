## SOQL

1. Try writing complex queries using **Apex** -

    - Query all accounts with all related contacts
    - Query all accounts with count of all related contacts
    - Query all accounts and its opporutnities that have more than 2 opporunitites
    - Query all accounts with all related opporutnities where opporunity amount is more than 10000
    - Query all accounts with sum of its all opportunity amounts
    - find average amount of all opportunities in the org
    - find min amount of all opp in the org
    - find max amount of all opp in the org
    - Query all opportunities where account country is USA (check actual valuesin system first)
    - query all opportunities whose accounts have more than 2 opportunities
